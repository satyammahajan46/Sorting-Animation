# Sorting-Animation

This repository contains code for a sorting animation program implemented in Java. The program provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms.

## Description

The "Sorting Animation" program is designed to visualize sorting algorithms using graphical animations. It demonstrates the step-by-step process of sorting elements in an array, allowing users to observe and understand how different sorting algorithms work.

The code consists of four files:

1. ControlComponent.java - This file contains the main control component responsible for managing the sorting animation and user interactions.
2. InsertComponent.java - This file implements the insertion sort algorithm and handles the animation logic.
3. InsertionSort.java - This file contains the implementation of the insertion sort algorithm and the sorting logic.
4. TheFrame.java - This file creates the main application frame and sets up the user interface.

## Installation and Usage

To run the "Sorting Animation" program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/satyammahajan46/Sorting-Animation.git
3. Compile the Java source files using the following command: javac *.java
4. 4. Run the program using the following command: java ControlComponent
